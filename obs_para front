These files are virtually identical — the only reason I kept them
separate is because normally you’d want to collect more info on a
user when they sign up than you’d need when they log in (in fact, you
can customize the signup form if you like… Django’s User model supports
email, first_name, and last_name fields in addition to username and password.
Be sure to add the relevant fields to the serializer, too, if you want the data
back). Both components are stateful to keep track of the data in their 
controlled inputs, and both have handle_change() methods to adjust the component’s
state when the user types something into the form. Also, they both receive a prop which
 dictates how the form should be processed upon submission.
